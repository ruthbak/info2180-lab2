            <h2> The Rise of the Robot </h2>

            <p>Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are revolutionizing the way we do things in our modern day world. Initially, robots were seen and associated with automation such as in factories or computing fields, but today, robots and sytems are everywhere in all fields of society. From healthcare to food to beauty and sports, Robots have definitely been on the rise and have been making their mark in our society.</p>
            <p>Although these machines and systems are on a rapid rise, it raises cause for concerns for some persons as they believe robots are here to not only improve already existing processes but to fully automate and take over human jobs. It sparks the question, will robots replace humans or will they work alongside as they have been doing over the past few decades. Robots and technology are pivotal in the advancement and development of our society, though they are fast emerging and seem like substitutions, humans will forever be at the focal point of the technological space and are will continue to be the driving force for new innovation happening around our world.</p>

            <h2> The Best Cookie Recipe </h2>
            <p class="date">October 7, 2024 by Ruth Bakare</p>
            <img src="chocochip.jpg" alt="A pciture of a chocolate chip cookie" class="float_left" width="350" height="250"/>
            <p>I don't know about you, but for me the best treat after a stressful day is a delicious soft and crumbly chocolate chip-cookie. Now, I'm not talking about your typical store bought cookie; whcih is usually suceptible to a tougher taste due to being on the shelf so long. I'm referring to a cookie that you can make right in the comfort of your home with just a few ingredients. With a crumbly edge and soft but not chewy center is the perfect balance of taste and texture and I am going to let you in on the secret to this amazing baked creation.</p>
            <p>The secret formula is using both brown and white sugar and letting the dough cool before baking it in the oven. Ofcourse, like any baked treat, you'll need basic ingredients such as flour, sugar, butter, eggs and lest we forget, chocolate chips! Once we mix these together, we scoop them unto a baking sheet and bake it at 350 degrees Farenheit for 10-12minutes. Once you hear the "ding!" take out your sheet and let them cool for a few minutes. And there you have it! The perfect treat to lighten up your mood for any occassion. Just a hint: They're best served with a chilled glass of milk.</p>
